## Incumbency Effect

In this project, we attempt to identify the answer to the question "Is Anti-Incumbency dead in India?" We run a logistic regression model across all state assembly elections since 1962 using data from the Trivedi Centre for Political Data. Our initial results suggest that anti-incumbency is definitely on the decline for some major states such as Uttar Pradesh.
